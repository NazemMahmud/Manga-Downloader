will only pull from [mangareader.net](https://www.mangareader.net/)

## Requirements:
* Python 3.X
* BeautifulSoup4
* PIP
* Requests

## How to Use:
Navigate to directory containing mangascraper.py in terminal. Then, run
```
$ python mangascraper.py
```


## To Do:
* Option to convert all retrieved images to a single pdf or mobi file
* Create a simple frontend GUI
* Create a standalone windows and linux executable using pyinstaller/py2exe
